# AIMNet2Calculator

This document provides detailed documentation of the `AIMNet2Calculator` class behavior.

## Overview

`AIMNet2Calculator` is a helper class for loading AIMNet2 models and performing inference. It handles:

- Model loading (from registry, file path, or `nn.Module`)
- External long-range (LR) module setup (Coulomb, DFTD3)
- Neighbor list computation and management
- Input preprocessing and output postprocessing
- Batching and periodic boundary conditions (PBC)

For LR module math and behavior, see [long_range.md](long_range.md).

## Quick Start

### Basic Inference

```python
from aimnet.calculators import AIMNet2Calculator

calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
result = calc({
    "coord": coords,    # (N, 3)
    "numbers": numbers, # (N,)
    "charge": 0.0,
})
energy = result["energy"]
```

### With Forces

```python
result = calc(data, forces=True)
forces = result["forces"]  # (N, 3)
```

### Periodic Systems

```python
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("dsf", cutoff=15.0)
result = calc({
    "coord": coords,
    "numbers": numbers,
    "charge": 0.0,
    "cell": cell,  # (3, 3)
}, forces=True, stress=True)
```

## Batched sparse neighbor matrices (mode 2)

Mode 2 represents several padded systems in one tensor. Coordinates, atomic numbers, and features have shape `(B, N, ...)`, where `B` is the number of systems and `N` is the padded atom capacity. Each system reserves its final atom slot as a dummy (`numbers[:, -1] == 0`); any additional zero-number atoms form a contiguous tail.

Neighbor indices are global: atom `j` in system `b` is `b*N + j`. The sentinel is `B*N`, and valid neighbors must precede the sentinel tail in every center row. A neighbor that targets a padded atom is also excluded and belongs to that tail. The primary and long-range matrices use the same representation:

```python
nbmat.shape == (B, N, M)
nbmat[b, i, k] == b * N + j       # valid neighbor
nbmat[b, i, k] == B * N           # excluded slot
```

Periodic mode 2 uses full three-dimensional cells. A `(B, 3, 3)` tensor gives each system its own cell; a single `(3, 3)` or `(1, 3, 3)` cell is broadcast to every system of the batch, the same way a `(3,)` `pbc` is. `pbc` is optional when a cell is supplied; if present, all three components must be true (partial or mixed periodicity is a content error, see the error semantics below). Each periodic neighbor matrix must have aligned integral lattice coefficients in `shifts.shape == (B, N, M, 3)`. Coordinates must be finite in every row, dummy rows included: they reach the periodic kernels with zero charge, and a non-finite dummy coordinate would still poison the Ewald structure factor. A system may consist of dummy rows only (a batch padded to a static size, for example); it contributes zero energy and does not influence the parameters estimated for the other systems. It must still carry a non-singular cell, so copy a real system's cell into the placeholder slot: a zero cell has no reciprocal lattice and would poison that system's energy and stress with `nan`, and it is rejected. Prefer a real cell over an artificially large one, since the batch shares one k-vector set sized from the largest cell. Ewald estimates its splitting parameter and k-space cutoff per system and PME one shared parameter set per batch, both from the real atoms only, so a system's energy does not depend on how much padding its batch carries and matches the flat evaluation to rounding (for PME the flat reference is the same batch of systems, because its parameters are shared across a batch in both layouts). Energy, forces, stress, and Hessian requests preserve the 3D execution path; Hessians select only real atoms and return `(R, 3, R, 3)` per system, where `R` excludes the padded tail. Batched Hessians stack when all systems have the same `R`, otherwise they return a list. Slab and mixed-periodicity inputs are not supported yet.

All four periodic long-range producers—DSF, DFT-D3, Ewald, and PME—use the same global indices and aligned shifts. Their periodic neighbor lists must represent each physical interaction symmetrically: if an edge uses shift `s`, the reverse edge must use the opposite shift `-s`. A directed or half neighbor list is not a valid input for these long-range observables. A full-observable request can be made directly:

```python
result = calc(
    {
        "coord": coord_batch,      # (B, N, 3), final atom padded
        "numbers": numbers_batch,  # (B, N)
        "charge": charges,
        "cell": cells,             # (B, 3, 3)
        "nbmat": nbmat_sr,             # (B, N, M_sr), global indices, model cutoff
        "shifts": shifts_sr,           # (B, N, M_sr, 3)
        "nbmat_lr": nbmat_lr,          # (B, N, M_lr), built at calc.cutoff_lr
        "shifts_lr": shifts_lr,
        "nbmat_coulomb": nbmat_coulomb,  # (B, N, M_c), built at the Ewald/PME real-space cutoff
        "shifts_coulomb": shifts_coulomb,
        "cutoff_coulomb": r_c,         # lets the calculator check that cutoff
        "nbmat_dftd3": nbmat_lr,       # may alias another list built at a sufficient cutoff
        "shifts_dftd3": shifts_lr,
    },
    forces=True,
    stress=True,
    hessian=True,
)
```

Calculator results from an explicit mode-2 Hessian split retain the singleton system axis for each recursive subsystem (for example, energy `(B, 1)` and forces `(B, 1, N, 3)`). This preserves the existing mode-2 collection behavior; the Hessian itself contains only real atoms.

**Coulomb neighbor-list cutoff.** In mode 2 the calculator builds no neighbor lists, so the caller also owns the real-space cutoff of the Ewald/PME sum. The kernels evaluate the damped real-space term over exactly the pairs in `nbmat_coulomb`, while the splitting parameter is estimated for a real-space cutoff of `r_c = sqrt(-2 ln ε) · (V² / N_real)^(1/6) / sqrt(2π)` per system (`ε` is `ewald_accuracy`, `V` the cell volume, `N_real` the number of real atoms). A `nbmat_coulomb` built with a shorter cutoff truncates the real-space sum silently, and the cost rises steeply with density. Aliasing the model's short-range list into it leaves an isolated small molecule within a few meV, but at `ewald_accuracy=1e-6` it costs of order 1 eV in energy and 0.1 eV/A in forces for a 64-molecule water box, which is far above any geometry-optimization or dynamics tolerance. Because `r_c` grows as `(V² / N_real)^(1/6)`, a dilute system needs a long list: a 4-atom ion in a 12 A cell asks for about 20 A, wider than the cell itself, so the list must carry several periodic images of the same pair. A minimum-image neighbor builder cannot satisfy that; `AdaptiveNeighborList` and ASE can. Build `nbmat_coulomb`/`shifts_coulomb` with a cutoff of at least the largest `r_c` in the batch (`nvalchemiops.torch.interactions.electrostatics.estimate_ewald_parameters` and `estimate_pme_parameters` return it as `real_space_cutoff`), and pass that cutoff as `cutoff_coulomb`: the calculator then warns when it is shorter than the estimate. The check follows whichever list the Coulomb sum resolved to, so a caller who supplies only `nbmat_lr` declares `cutoff_lr` instead. Leaving the cutoff undeclared also warns, because an unchecked list is the case this trap actually reaches. The short-range list, `nbmat_lr`, and `nbmat_dftd3` keep their own cutoffs (the model cutoff, `cutoff_lr`, and the DFT-D3 cutoff).

Legacy local matrices can be converted when their exclusions are already tail-packed:

```python
from aimnet import nbops

nbmat_global = nbops.convert_mode2_local_to_global(
    nbmat_local,
    padding_mask=padding_mask,
)
```

The helper does not reorder slots. If exclusions are interleaved, the producer must repack both the neighbor matrix and its aligned shifts together; moving indices alone would assign the wrong periodic image. This is an intentional API break for callers that previously supplied local 3D mode-2 indices.

Mode-2 input is validated before any neighbor tensor is narrowed or handed to a kernel: index bounds, per-system ownership, packed sentinel tails, shift alignment, finite coordinates, and the dummy-row layout. A plain evaluation validates once: the calculator validates its converted batch and marks it so the model's `prepare_input` does not repeat the work (the mark never reaches the caller's dict). A standalone model validates on every call. A Hessian request on a batch validates the batch once before splitting it and each subsystem once more in its own evaluation. Layout errors that need no tensor read (a wrong rank, dtype, or shape) raise `ValueError` in eager code; inside a `fullgraph=True` trace they surface as the compiler's error instead. Content errors depend on where they are detected: eager CPU raises `ValueError`; CUDA and any `torch.compile` trace queue a device-side assertion that raises `RuntimeError` without a host synchronization, and on CUDA the assertion poisons the context, so restart the CUDA process after a validation failure there. Partial or mixed periodicity is a content error and follows the same rule.

### Changing Coulomb Methods

```python
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("dsf", cutoff=15.0, dsf_alpha=0.2)

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("ewald")

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("pme")

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("simple")
```

## Constructor

```python
AIMNet2Calculator(
    model: str | nn.Module = "aimnet2",
    nb_threshold: int = 120,
    needs_coulomb: bool | None = None,
    needs_dispersion: bool | None = None,
    device: str | None = None,
    compile_model: bool = False,
    compile_kwargs: dict | None = None,
    cache_static: bool = False,
    train: bool = False,
    deterministic: bool = False,
    ensemble_member: int = 0,
    revision: str | None = None,
    token: str | None = None,
    *,
    model_import_paths: Collection[str] | None = None,
    model_import_mode: Literal["extend", "replace", "unsafe"] = "extend",
)
```

### Parameters

#### `model`

Model to use for inference.

| Type | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `str` (registry name) | Loads from model registry (e.g., `"aimnet2"`), downloading if needed |
| `str` (file path) | Loads from `.pt` (v2) or `.jpt` (v1 legacy) file if the path exists |
| `str` (HF repo ID) | Loads from Hugging Face Hub (e.g., `"isayevlab/aimnet2-wb97m-d3"`); requires `aimnet[hf]` |
| `str` (local HF dir) | Loads from a local directory with `config.json` + `ensemble_N.safetensors` |
| `torch.nn.Module` | Uses provided module directly |

For `torch.nn.Module`, metadata is read from `model.metadata` attribute if available (v2 models).

### Custom serialized models

Direct local v2 files and complete Hugging Face repositories can extend or replace the trusted model-YAML import paths, or use unsafe loading for locally trusted artifacts. See [Model YAML import policy](model_format.md#model-yaml-import-policy) for the default allowlist, modes, examples, and security boundaries.

Model weights load on CPU before the completed model moves to the requested device once. Missing real state-dict keys are fatal; unexpected keys warn for direct custom/HF artifacts and fail for registry artifacts. Known migration keys remain filtered.

For a legacy TorchScript file, use `AIMNet2Calculator.from_legacy_jit()` when you want the trusted-code boundary to be explicit:

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator.from_legacy_jit("trusted-model.jpt", device="cpu")
```

#### `nb_threshold`

Threshold for batching/flattening decisions. Default: `120`.

The calculator uses two input modes:

1. **Fully connected (mode 0)**: 3D batched input for coordinates `(num_mols, num_atoms, 3)` with all-pairs interactions (dense O(N²)). Fast on GPU for small systems.
2. **Flattened + neighbor lists (mode 1)**: 2D input for coordinates `(num_atoms, 3)` with `mol_idx` and neighbor lists (sparse O(N)). Used for large systems, CPU execution, and periodic systems.

| Condition | Behavior | Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `N > nb_threshold` | If input is mode 0 (3D), flatten to mode 1 (2D with `mol_idx`) | O(N) linear |
| `device == "cpu"` | If input is mode 0 (3D), always flatten to mode 1 | O(N) linear |
| `N < nb_threshold` and CUDA | Keep mode 0 (3D) | O(N²) fully connected |

This affects memory usage and performance for batched inference. The mode=0 path uses a fully connected graph (all-pairs interactions), which scales as O(N²) but is fast for GPU. The mode=1 path uses neighbor lists, which scale linearly with system size. Fully connected mode is not used for periodic systems; PBC inputs always go through neighbor lists.

#### `needs_coulomb`

Whether to attach external Coulomb module.

| Value            | Behavior                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `None` (default) | Determined from model metadata              |
| `True`           | Force external Coulomb (overrides metadata) |
| `False`          | No external Coulomb (overrides metadata)    |

Only affects v2 format models. Legacy JIT models have embedded Coulomb. `False` may explicitly disable an otherwise valid external Coulomb correction; it does not make structurally inconsistent metadata valid. `True` is rejected for `coulomb_mode="full_embedded"`. For a valid `coulomb_mode="none"` model with Coulomb explicitly enabled and no stored SR parameters, the external module uses `rc=4.6` Å and `envelope="exp"`.

#### `needs_dispersion`

Whether to attach external DFTD3 module.

| Value            | Behavior                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `None` (default) | Determined from model metadata            |
| `True`           | Force external DFTD3 (overrides metadata) |
| `False`          | No external DFTD3 (overrides metadata)    |

Only affects new-format models. `False` may explicitly disable external dispersion when the artifact is structurally valid. `True` requires complete `s8`, `a1`, and `a2` parameters and is rejected when D3TS is already embedded.

#### `device`

Device to run the model on.

| Value            | Behavior                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `None` (default) | Auto-detect: uses CUDA if available, else CPU |
| `"cuda"`         | Force CUDA device                             |
| `"cpu"`          | Force CPU device                              |
| `"cuda:N"`       | Specific CUDA device (e.g., `"cuda:1"`)       |

#### `compile_model`

Whether to compile the model with `torch.compile()` for faster inference.

| Value             | Behavior                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `False` (default) | No compilation                       |
| `True`            | Compile model with `torch.compile()` |

Compilation adds overhead on first call but speeds up subsequent calls. Useful for MD trajectories, geometry optimizations, or repeated evaluations.
Compilation always uses `fullgraph=True`; passing `fullgraph=False` in
`compile_kwargs` is rejected. Legacy TorchScript `.jpt` models do not support
this option. Hessian and Hessian-vector-product requests use the original eager
model while ordinary compiled evaluations continue to share that model's
parameters and state.

#### `compile_kwargs`

Additional keyword arguments to pass to `torch.compile()`. Default is `None`.

```python
# Example: use reduce-overhead mode for lower latency
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", compile_model=True, compile_kwargs={"mode": "reduce-overhead"})
```

See [torch.compile documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.compile.html) for available options.

#### `cache_static`

Opt-in cache for exact repeated static CUDA inputs. Default: `False`.

When enabled, the calculator can reuse calculator-built neighbor matrices and detached external DFTD3 energy/force terms for repeated calls with the same resident CUDA `coord` and `numbers` tensors. The cache key tracks tensor identity, storage pointer, shape, stride, and PyTorch's tensor version counter, so ordinary in-place coordinate or species changes invalidate the cache.

Charge and multiplicity are intentionally not part of this geometry cache key. This allows same-geometry property grids, for example AIMNet2-NSE or cDFT-style calculations over different charge or multiplicity settings, to reuse geometry-dependent work while the model still recomputes charge-dependent outputs.

The cache is bypassed for CPU inputs, periodic inputs, Hessian calls, stress calls, training mode, caller-provided `mol_idx`, caller-provided `nbmat`, and host/NumPy inputs that are copied to CUDA inside the calculator. It does not cache model outputs, Coulomb terms, or moving-geometry neighbor lists.

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", device="cuda", nb_threshold=0, cache_static=True)
result_q0 = calc({"coord": coord_cuda, "numbers": numbers_cuda, "charge": 0.0}, forces=True)
result_q1 = calc({"coord": coord_cuda, "numbers": numbers_cuda, "charge": 1.0}, forces=True)
```

#### `train`

Whether to put the model in training mode. Default: `False`.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `False` (default) | Inference mode: model set to `.eval()`, all parameters set to `requires_grad_(False)` |
| `True` | Training mode: model set to `.train()`, parameters keep `requires_grad` |

For ordinary energy/force/charge inference (including external autograd through the calculator), leave this `False`. Set `True` only when using the calculator inside a training loop where model parameters need gradients.

#### `deterministic`

Route external DFT-D3 (and DSF Coulomb) through their differentiable pure-torch paths instead of the atomics-based nvalchemiops CUDA kernels. Default: `False`.

The kernel defaults accumulate pairwise terms with atomic adds, so repeated identical evaluations differ at the float32 rounding level (~1e-7 eV in energies). That noise is physically negligible but is amplified chaotically by iterative optimizers: batched geometry optimizations from byte-identical inputs can follow different trajectories. With `deterministic=True`, identical inputs give bitwise-identical energies and forces on the same machine and build, at negligible cost for typical batched workloads.

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", deterministic=True)
```

Notes:

- Covers external D3 and `simple`/`dsf` Coulomb. Ewald/PME kernels are not covered; a one-time `UserWarning` fires if combined.
- The pure-torch paths materialize pairwise tensors, so for very large single systems the kernel defaults are faster; benchmark before enabling in large-system MD.
- Reproducibility holds per machine/build; a different GPU or PyTorch build still shifts results at rounding level.
- The `cache_static` DFTD3 term cache does not apply in this mode.

#### `ensemble_member`

Which ensemble member to load when loading from a Hugging Face repo. Default: `0`.

Ensemble members are indexed 0–3. Only applies when `model` is a HF repo ID or a local HF-style directory (containing `config.json` + `ensemble_N.safetensors`).

#### `revision`

HF repo revision (branch, tag, or commit hash) to load from. Default: `None` (latest).

Only applies when `model` is a HF repo ID.

#### `token`

HF API token for accessing private or gated repositories. Default: `None`.

Set via environment variable `HF_TOKEN` as an alternative to passing it directly.

Only applies when `model` is a HF repo ID.

#### `model_import_paths` and `model_import_mode`

These settings apply only to direct local v2 artifacts and complete Hugging Face repositories with their own `model_yaml`. Registry names, registry fallback, raw `nn.Module` inputs, and `.jpt` files reject non-default settings.

See [Model YAML import policy](model_format.md#model-yaml-import-policy) for supported paths, modes, examples, and security boundaries.

### Metadata Resolution

```
Priority: explicit flags > model metadata > no external modules
```

Artifacts are validated before these flags are applied. Direct local and complete custom Hugging Face artifacts must be structurally consistent; official registry artifacts and registry-backed HF fallbacks additionally enforce canonical action flags. The calculator then validates the effective configuration after family defaults and explicit flags are resolved. Explicit `False` values can disable external components, but cannot bypass intrinsic structural errors.

| Model Source             | Metadata Source            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| File path (`.pt`/`.jpt`) | Loaded from file           |
| `nn.Module`              | `model.metadata` attribute |
| No metadata + no flags   | No external LR modules     |

## Properties

### `device`

Device string (e.g., `"cuda"`, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`). Set via constructor parameter or auto-detected.

### `cutoff`

Short-range model cutoff in Angstroms. Typically 5.0 Å.

### `cutoff_lr`

Primary long-range cutoff reference. Used for backward compatibility with legacy models.

### `coulomb_cutoff`

Coulomb-specific cutoff distance. Tracked separately from the DFTD3 cutoff.

| Method | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `"simple"` | `inf` (all pairs) |
| `"dsf"` | Configured cutoff (default 15.0 Å) |
| `"ewald"` | `None` (real-space cutoff estimated per call from `ewald_accuracy`) |
| `"pme"` | `None` (real-space cutoff estimated per call from `ewald_accuracy`) |

### `dftd3_cutoff`

DFTD3-specific cutoff distance. Default: 15.0 Å.

**Neighbor list behavior:**

The calculator keeps Coulomb and DFTD3 cutoffs independent. Long-range neighbor lists are:

- **Shared** when both cutoffs are finite and within 20% of each other
- **Separate** when both cutoffs are finite and differ by more than 20%
- **All pairs** for `"simple"` Coulomb (effectively no cutoff)
- **Per-call dense list (`nbmat_coulomb`/`shifts_coulomb`, also aliased to `nbmat_lr`/`shifts_lr`)** for Ewald and PME, sized to the real-space cutoff derived from `ewald_accuracy` and the cell

**Data dictionary keys:**

LR modules prefer their specific suffix, falling back to `_lr`:

- **LRCoulomb**: Tries `nbmat_coulomb` first, falls back to `nbmat_lr`
- **DFTD3/D3TS**: Tries `nbmat_dftd3` first, falls back to `nbmat_lr`

When neighbor lists are shared, all keys point to the same array.

**Modifying cutoffs:**

- `set_lr_cutoff(cutoff)`: Updates both Coulomb and DFTD3 cutoffs (skips Ewald/PME, which manage their own real-space cutoff)
- `set_lrcoulomb_method(method, cutoff, ewald_accuracy)`: Updates Coulomb method/cutoff (and Ewald/PME accuracy)
- `set_dftd3_cutoff(cutoff)`: Updates DFTD3 cutoff only

### `has_external_coulomb`

`True` if external `LRCoulomb` module is attached. `False` for legacy models with embedded Coulomb.

### `has_external_dftd3`

`True` if external `DFTD3` module is attached. `False` for legacy models or D3TS models.

### `coulomb_method`

Current Coulomb method: `"simple"`, `"dsf"`, `"ewald"`, `"pme"`, or `None`.

Returns `None` for:

- Legacy models with embedded Coulomb
- Models without Coulomb

**Note on Ewald and PME:**

Both Ewald and PME use a per-call real-space cutoff derived from `ewald_accuracy` and the cell geometry. When either is selected, `coulomb_cutoff` is `None`; the calculator builds a dedicated dense neighbor list (`nbmat_coulomb`/`shifts_coulomb`) sized to that cutoff and aliases it to `nbmat_lr`/`shifts_lr`.

## Methods

### `eval(data, forces=False, stress=False, hessian=False)`

Main inference method. Also callable via `calculator(data, ...)`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Default  | Description                             |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `data`    | `dict` | required | Input data dictionary                   |
| `forces`  | `bool` | `False`  | Compute atomic forces                   |
| `stress`  | `bool` | `False`  | Compute stress tensor (requires `cell`) |
| `hessian` | `bool` | `False`  | Compute Hessian matrix                  |

**Returns:** Dictionary with computed outputs.

**Example:**

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
result = calc.eval({
    "coord": coords,      # (N, 3) or (B, N, 3)
    "numbers": numbers,   # (N,) or (B, N)
    "charge": charge,     # (1,) or (B,)
}, forces=True)

energy = result["energy"]
forces = result["forces"]
charges = result["charges"]
```

### `set_lrcoulomb_method(method, cutoff=15.0, dsf_alpha=0.2, ewald_accuracy=1e-6)`

Set the long-range Coulomb method.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `method` | `str` | required | `"simple"`, `"dsf"`, `"ewald"`, or `"pme"` |
| `cutoff` | `float` | `15.0` | Cutoff for DSF method (Å). Not used for Ewald/PME. |
| `dsf_alpha` | `float` | `0.2` | Alpha parameter for DSF method |
| `ewald_accuracy` | `float` | `1e-6` | Target accuracy for Ewald and PME |

**Behavior:**

| Method     | Description                    | Coulomb cutoff          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `"simple"` | Direct Coulomb sum (all pairs) | `inf`                   |
| `"dsf"`    | Damped shifted force           | Configured cutoff       |
| `"ewald"`  | Ewald summation                | Estimated from accuracy |
| `"pme"`    | Particle Mesh Ewald            | Estimated from accuracy |

**Ewald / PME Accuracy:**

For both Ewald and PME, `ewald_accuracy` (default `1e-6`, matching the nvalchemiops default) controls the splitting parameter, real-space cutoff, and reciprocal-space resolution. The calculator estimates these per call from the cell geometry; smaller values give tighter convergence at higher cost.

**Derivative Support:**

All external Coulomb methods support inference forces/stress, force/stress losses in `train=True`, and Hessian/HVP requests. DSF routes training and Hessians through its differentiable closed-form torch path; `ewald` and `pme` keep their nvalchemiops energy in the autograd graph (nvalchemi-toolkit-ops >= 0.4.1; selecting `pme` on 0.4.0 raises `RuntimeError`), so all derivatives come from the calculator's total-energy autograd and are relaxed-charge. Global mode-2 batches (see [Batched sparse neighbor matrices (mode 2)](#batched-sparse-neighbor-matrices-mode-2)) support the same observables on the 3D execution path; their Hessians select real atoms.

See [Long-Range Methods → Derivative Support](long_range.md#derivative-support) for details.

**Notes:**

- Updates external `LRCoulomb` module if present
- Automatically updates neighbor lists
- Issues warning for legacy models (no effect)
- Auto-switches to `"dsf"` when PBC is detected with `"simple"` method (see PBC notes below)
- Ewald/PME require `cell` to be present in input; otherwise raises `ValueError`

**Example:**

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("dsf", cutoff=12.0, dsf_alpha=0.20)
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("ewald", ewald_accuracy=1e-6)
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("pme", ewald_accuracy=1e-6)
```

### `set_lr_cutoff(cutoff)`

Set the unified long-range cutoff for all LR modules.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type    | Description                               |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `cutoff`  | `float` | Cutoff distance (Å) for LR neighbor lists |

**Notes:**

- Updates both Coulomb and DFTD3 cutoffs
- Ewald and PME ignore this cutoff (they manage their own real-space cutoff)
- Automatically rebuilds neighbor lists

**Example:**

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
calc.set_lr_cutoff(20.0)  # Updates both Coulomb and DFTD3 cutoffs
```

### `set_dftd3_cutoff(cutoff=None, smoothing_fraction=None)`

Set DFTD3 cutoff and smoothing.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter            | Type   | Default | Description |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `cutoff`             | `float | None`   | `15.0`      | Cutoff distance (Å)                        |
| `smoothing_fraction` | `float | None`   | `0.2`       | Fraction of cutoff used as smoothing width |

**Notes:**

- Only updates smoothing parameters for external DFTD3 modules
- Always updates neighbor list cutoffs used by the calculator
- For legacy models with embedded DFTD3, the embedded module’s smoothing parameters do not change, but the neighbor list cutoff provided by the calculator can still change dispersion behavior

**Example:**

```python
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
calc.set_dftd3_cutoff(cutoff=20.0, smoothing_fraction=0.25)  # smoothing from 15A to 20A
```

### Input Conversion

The calculator automatically converts:

- NumPy arrays → PyTorch tensors
- Python lists → PyTorch tensors
- Scalar tensors → Shape `(1,)`
- All tensors → Correct dtype and device

Any keys not listed in required/optional tables are ignored during input conversion.

### Autograd Graph Preservation

When `coord` is passed as a PyTorch tensor with `requires_grad=True`, the calculator preserves the full autograd graph from `coord` to the output energy. This allows external higher-order differentiation — for example, computing a Hessian via `torch.autograd.functional.hessian()` without using the built-in `hessian=True` flag:

```python
import torch
from aimnet.calculators import AIMNet2Calculator

calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
numbers = torch.tensor([[8, 1, 1]])
charge = torch.tensor([0.0])

coords = torch.tensor([[0.0, 0.0, 0.1], [0.0, 0.76, -0.47], [0.0, -0.76, -0.47]])

def energy_fn(x):
    out = calc({"coord": x.unsqueeze(0), "numbers": numbers, "charge": charge}, forces=False)
    return out["energy"][0]

H = torch.autograd.functional.hessian(energy_fn, coords)  # shape (N, 3, N, 3)
```

!!! note "Use `forces=False` for external Hessians"

    When computing higher-order derivatives from outside the calculator, pass `forces=False`. Requesting `forces=True` triggers an internal backward pass that frees intermediate activations, preventing a second differentiation through the graph.

!!! note "Long-range backends and external differentiation"

    Every long-range backend keeps its energy in the autograd graph for higher-order differentiation: DSF routes through its differentiable torch path, and Ewald/PME (nvalchemi-toolkit-ops >= 0.4.1) are energy-graph-only, so external `torch.autograd.functional.hessian` captures the complete relaxed-charge Coulomb Hessian.

When `coord` does **not** have `requires_grad=True` (the default), inputs are detached as before — optimization loops that call the calculator repeatedly incur no graph accumulation overhead.

## Output Format

`energy`: `(1,)` or `(B,)`, total energy per molecule.

`charges`: `(N,)` or `(B, N)`, atomic partial charges.

`forces`: `(N, 3)` or `(B, N, 3)`, when requested.

`stress`: `(3, 3)` or `(B, 3, 3)`, when requested.

`hessian`: `(N, 3, N, 3)` or batched mode-2 equivalents, over real atoms.

**Notes:**

- `forces` requires `forces=True` in `eval()`
- `stress` requires `stress=True` and `cell` in input
- `hessian` requires `hessian=True`; explicit batched mode 2 supports stacked or ragged per-system results

## Batching and Neighbor Modes

The calculator chooses between dense and sparse execution based on system size and device. The goal is to keep small GPU workloads fast while keeping large or CPU workloads linear in memory.

### Dense Mode (O(N²))

- **When**: `N < nb_threshold` **and** CUDA is available
- **Input**: 3D batched `(B, N, 3)`
- **Behavior**: No neighbor list; the model uses a fully connected graph
- **Tradeoff**: Fast on GPU for small molecules, but quadratic memory

### Sparse Mode (O(N))

- **When**: `N > nb_threshold` **or** CPU execution
- **Input**: Flattened 2D `(N_total, 3)` with `mol_idx`
- **Behavior**: Adaptive neighbor lists limit interactions to within `cutoff`
- **Tradeoff**: Linear memory with a small overhead for neighbor list construction

### Mode 2: Batched Sparse (manual)

- **Input**: 3D batched `(B, N, 3)` plus 3D neighbor matrix `(B, N, max_nb)`
- **Note**: Supported by the model, but not selected automatically. Use this mode by supplying a 3D `nbmat` explicitly.

### Choosing the Right Mode

The calculator automatically selects between two execution modes:

**Mode 0 (Dense, O(N²) fully connected):** Every atom interacts with every other atom in an all-to-all manner. No neighbor list is constructed. This mode is only used for **batches of small molecules with the same number of atoms on GPU**. Specifically:

- Input must be 3D batched coordinates (B, N, 3)
- N ≤ nb_threshold (default 120 atoms per molecule)
- CUDA device available
- No periodic boundary conditions

In this case, the O(N²) fully connected approach is more efficient than constructing neighbor lists.

**Mode 1 (Sparse, O(N) with neighbor lists):** Uses adaptive neighbor lists to limit interactions to atoms within cutoff distance. This mode is used in all other cases:

- Periodic boundary conditions (required for periodic images)
- CPU execution
- Large systems (N > nb_threshold)
- Variable-sized molecules

**Key Takeaways:**

- PBC always requires neighbor lists (Mode 1)
- CPU always uses neighbor lists (Mode 1)
- Small batched molecules on GPU use fully connected (Mode 0)
- Large systems use neighbor lists (Mode 1)

### Flattening Logic

For 3D batched inputs, `AIMNet2Calculator` decides whether to flatten based on `nb_threshold`:

```python
# nb_threshold default is 120
if device == "cpu" or max_atoms > nb_threshold:
    # FLATTEN -> Mode 1 (Sparse)
    # Computes neighbor list
else:
    # KEEP 3D -> Mode 0 (Dense)
    # Implicit all-pairs
```

## Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)

### Input Requirements

```python
data = {
    "coord": coords,
    "numbers": numbers,
    "charge": charge,
    "cell": cell,  # (3, 3) or (num_systems, 3, 3)
}
```

### Behavior

1. Coordinates wrapped into unit cell via `move_coord_to_cell()`
2. Neighbor lists include periodic image shifts
3. Coulomb method auto-switches to `"dsf"` if `"simple"` (with warning). For legacy JIT models the embedded Coulomb method cannot be changed at runtime; the warning indicates that only the calculator’s external setting was updated.
4. Multiple molecules with PBC: raises `NotImplementedError` for a dense 3D batch; a global mode-2 batch is supported (see [Batched sparse neighbor matrices](#batched-sparse-neighbor-matrices-mode-2))

### Coulomb Method for PBC

| Initial Method                | Action                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `"simple"`                    | Auto-switch to `"dsf"` with warning |
| `"dsf"` / `"ewald"` / `"pme"` | No change                           |

## Neighbor List Management

### Adaptive Neighbor Lists

The calculator uses `AdaptiveNeighborList` for automatic buffer management in **Mode 1**:

- **Initial sizing**: Based on density estimate and cutoff
- **Overflow handling**: Increases buffer by 1.5x and retries
- **Underutilization**: Shrinks if utilization < 2/3 of target (hysteresis)
- **Minimum buffer**: 16 neighbors
- **Memory alignment**: Rounded to multiples of 16

### Neighbor List Format and Padding

- Neighbor lists are stored as integer matrices `nbmat` with shape `(N_total, max_neighbors)`.
- Each row contains neighbor indices for a single atom.
- Rows are padded with a dummy index (typically `N_total`) when an atom has fewer neighbors than `max_neighbors`.
- Direct flat `nb_mode=1` module inputs must include a final padding atom. That atom should have `numbers[-1] == 0`, `charges[-1] == 0`, and invalid neighbor entries should point to its index.
- The buffer grows on overflow (×1.5) and shrinks when utilization drops well below target, which helps performance remain stable as density changes.

### Module Suffix Fallback

LR modules prefer their specific neighbor list key, with fallback to `_lr`:

- **LRCoulomb (simple/dsf/ewald/pme)**: Tries `nbmat_coulomb`, falls back to `nbmat_lr`
- **DFTD3/D3TS**: Tries `nbmat_dftd3`, falls back to `nbmat_lr`

**Note:** For Ewald and PME, the calculator builds a per-call dense neighbor list sized to the real-space cutoff derived from `ewald_accuracy`. The list is written under `nbmat_coulomb`/`shifts_coulomb` and aliased to `nbmat_lr`/`shifts_lr`.

## Device Handling

### Automatic Selection

```python
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
```

### Placement

| Component          | Device                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Model              | `self.device`              |
| External LRCoulomb | `self.device`              |
| External DFTD3     | `self.device`              |
| Input tensors      | Converted to `self.device` |
| Output tensors     | Remain on `self.device`    |

## External LR Module Configuration

### LRCoulomb Setup

When `needs_coulomb=True`:

```python
LRCoulomb(
    key_in="charges",
    key_out="energy",
    method="simple",  # Default, changeable via set_lrcoulomb_method()
    rc=4.6 if metadata.get("coulomb_sr_rc") is None else metadata["coulomb_sr_rc"],
    envelope="exp" if metadata.get("coulomb_sr_envelope") is None else metadata["coulomb_sr_envelope"],
    subtract_sr=not sr_embedded,  # Based on coulomb_mode
)
```

### DFTD3 Setup

When `needs_dispersion=True` and `d3_params` available:

```python
DFTD3(
    s8=d3_params["s8"],
    a1=d3_params["a1"],
    a2=d3_params["a2"],
    s6=d3_params.get("s6", 1.0),
)
```

### How LR Modules Are Attached

External LR modules are attached based on model metadata unless overridden by constructor flags:

- If `needs_coulomb=True`, an external `LRCoulomb` is created. If `coulomb_mode="sr_embedded"`, the model already subtracts SR Coulomb internally and the external module adds full Coulomb on top.
- If `needs_dispersion=True` and `d3_params` are present, an external `DFTD3` is created. If `d3_params` are missing, initialization raises `ValueError`.

Explicit `needs_coulomb` / `needs_dispersion` flags override metadata after structural validation. An explicit `False` disables the corresponding external module; effective runtime validation still rejects incompatible enabled components.

### Cutoff Handling for LR Modules

- **Coulomb**: `set_lrcoulomb_method()` selects the method and updates the Coulomb cutoff (`inf` for `"simple"`, finite for `"dsf"`, `None` for `"ewald"`/`"pme"`).
- **DFTD3**: `set_dftd3_cutoff()` updates the DFTD3 cutoff and smoothing window.
- **Unified control**: `set_lr_cutoff()` sets both Coulomb and DFTD3 cutoffs to the same value.
- **Ewald/PME**: Use per-call real-space neighbor lists estimated from `ewald_accuracy`; calculator cutoffs do not apply.

## Default Values

### LR Module Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `set_lrcoulomb_method(..., cutoff=15.0)` | `15.0` | Default LR cutoff for DSF (Å) |
| `set_lrcoulomb_method(..., ewald_accuracy=1e-6)` | `1e-6` | Default accuracy for Ewald and PME |
| `set_dftd3_cutoff(..., smoothing_fraction=0.2)` | `0.2` | DFTD3 smoothing width as fraction of cutoff |

### Coulomb Defaults

| Parameter             | Default | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `coulomb_sr_rc`       | `4.6` Å | Short-range Coulomb cutoff                |
| `coulomb_sr_envelope` | `"exp"` | Envelope function (`"exp"` or `"cosine"`) |

#### SR Coulomb Cutoff Constraint

**`coulomb_sr_rc` must be ≤ model `cutoff`**

The short-range Coulomb cutoff defines the distance within which SR Coulomb interactions are computed by the embedded `SRCoulomb` module. This cutoff must be less than or equal to the model's short-range cutoff because:

- SRCoulomb uses the same neighbor list as the neural network
- Atom pairs beyond the model cutoff are not visible to SRCoulomb
- Typical configuration: `coulomb_sr_rc=4.6` Å with model `cutoff=5.0` Å

The envelope function (`"exp"` or `"cosine"`) determines how the SR interaction smoothly decays to zero at the cutoff boundary.

## Legacy Model Compatibility

Legacy JIT models (`.jpt`) have different behavior:

Their synthesized runtime metadata remains format version 1 and records `has_embedded_lr=True`, `coulomb_mode="full_embedded"`, and no external long-range modules by default. This preserves legacy LR neighbor handling while preventing an additional external Coulomb module from being attached.

| Feature | Legacy | New Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coulomb | Embedded in model | External module |
| DFTD3/D3BJ | Embedded in model | External module |
| `set_lrcoulomb_method()` | Warning, no effect | Updates method |
| `set_lr_cutoff()` | No effect on embedded modules | Updates `cutoff_lr` for all LR modules |
| `set_dftd3_cutoff()` | No effect on embedded modules | Updates smoothing for external DFTD3 |
| `has_external_coulomb` | `False` | `True` (if applicable) |

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Condition | Error |
| --- | --- |
| Invalid model type | `TypeError` |
| Missing required input key | `KeyError` |
| Hessian with hand-flattened multi-molecule input, or a dense 3D batch with `B > 1` | `NotImplementedError` (a global mode-2 batch splits per system instead) |
| PME with nvalchemi-toolkit-ops < 0.4.1 | `RuntimeError` |
| PBC with multiple molecules in a dense 3D batch | `NotImplementedError` (supported in global mode 2) |
| Invalid Coulomb method | `ValueError` |
| `needs_dispersion=True` without `d3_params` | `ValueError` |
| Partial or mixed PBC in mode 2 | `ValueError` on eager CPU; `RuntimeError` on CUDA or under `torch.compile` |

### Warnings

| Condition                                | Warning                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `set_lrcoulomb_method()` on legacy model | Warns, no effect         |
| PBC with `"simple"` Coulomb              | Auto-switches to `"dsf"` |

## Complete Example

```python
import torch
from aimnet.calculators import AIMNet2Calculator

# Create calculator
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")

# Check configuration
print(f"Device: {calc.device}")
print(f"Cutoff: {calc.cutoff}")
print(f"Has external Coulomb: {calc.has_external_coulomb}")
print(f"Coulomb method: {calc.coulomb_method}")

# Configure for PBC
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("dsf", cutoff=12.0)

# Prepare input
data = {
    "coord": torch.randn(20, 3),
    "numbers": torch.randint(1, 10, (20,)),
    "charge": torch.tensor([0.0]),
}

# Run inference
result = calc.eval(data, forces=True)

print(f"Energy: {result['energy']}")
print(f"Forces shape: {result['forces'].shape}")
print(f"Charges shape: {result['charges'].shape}")
```

## Performance Tips

### Hardware Acceleration

**Use GPU for best performance:**

```python
# Automatically uses CUDA if available
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")
print(calc.device)  # "cuda" or "cpu"
```

GPU provides 10-50x speedup over CPU for typical workloads.

### Compile Mode

**Use `compile_model=True` for additional speedup:**

```python
# Basic compilation
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", compile_model=True)

# With custom compile options
calc = AIMNet2Calculator(
    "aimnet2",
    compile_model=True,
    compile_kwargs={"mode": "reduce-overhead"}
)
```

**Characteristics:**

- First call will be slow (compilation overhead)
- Subsequent calls are faster
- Works with both periodic and non-periodic systems

**When to use:**

- Long MD trajectories
- Geometry optimization with many steps
- Repeated evaluation on same system size

**When not to use:**

- Single evaluations (compilation overhead outweighs benefit)
- Varying system sizes (may trigger recompilation)

### Memory Management

**Tune `nb_threshold` for your workload:**

```python
# Conservative (less memory, earlier sparse mode)
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", nb_threshold=80)

# Aggressive (more memory, faster on GPU)
calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2", nb_threshold=150)
```

**For large systems on GPU:**

- Lower `nb_threshold` to use sparse mode
- Reduces memory footprint
- Enables processing larger molecules

**For many small molecules:**

- Higher `nb_threshold` to use dense mode longer
- Maximizes GPU parallelism
- Faster overall throughput

### Pre-compute Neighbor Lists

**Avoid recomputation by caching:**

```python
# First call: computes neighbor lists
result1 = calc(data, forces=True)

# If geometry unchanged, reuse same data dict
# Calculator caches neighbor lists internally
result2 = calc(data, forces=False)  # Reuses cached lists
```

**For custom workflows, provide nbmat explicitly:**

```python
# Compute once
nbmat, _, shifts = compute_neighbor_list(coords, cutoff=5.0)

# Use many times
for _ in range(1000):
    result = calc({
        "coord": coords,
        "numbers": numbers,
        "charge": 0.0,
        "nbmat": nbmat,
        "shifts": shifts,
    }, forces=True)
```

### Coulomb Method Selection

**Choose method for your system:**

| System Type | Method | Parameter | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small non-PBC | `"simple"` | N/A | All pairs, exact |
| Large non-PBC | `"dsf"` | cutoff=12-15 Å | O(N) scaling |
| PBC systems | `"dsf"` | cutoff=12-15 Å | Fast and robust default |
| High-accuracy PBC | `"ewald"` | `ewald_accuracy=1e-6` | Reciprocal sum on k-grid |
| Large PBC cells | `"pme"` | `ewald_accuracy=1e-6` | Better asymptotic scaling than Ewald |

```python
calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("simple")

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("dsf", cutoff=15.0)

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("ewald")

calc.set_lrcoulomb_method("pme")
```

### Multi-threading (CPU)

**Set thread count for CPU execution:**

```python
import torch
torch.set_num_threads(4)  # Use 4 CPU cores

calc = AIMNet2Calculator("aimnet2")  # Will use CPU
```

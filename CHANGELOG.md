## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Cleared 20 of the 21 open Dependabot alerts by upgrading locked development dependencies: GitPython 3.1.56 to 3.1.62 (13 alerts, one critical and eight high), cryptography 49.0.0 to 50.0.1, tornado 6.5.7 to 6.5.8 (3 alerts), mkdocs-material 9.7.0 to 9.7.7, and setuptools 81.0.0 to 84.0.0. None is a runtime dependency; every alert was against `uv.lock`, so no published install was affected. setuptools could not move on its own because the locked torch held it back, so the locked torch goes from 2.12.1 to 2.13.0, which also clears the `torch.jit.script` advisory and puts the default lane on a current version in the supported 2.10 to 2.14 matrix. triton stays at 3.7.1, which is its correct pairing; 3.8 requires torch 2.14. The one remaining alert is a low-severity paramiko issue with no released patch, reached only as a third-level test dependency through fabric and pysisyphus.
- Upgraded transitive lockfile dependencies to patched versions for all open Dependabot alerts with available fixes (GitPython, Mako, Pillow, cryptography, idna, msgpack, pymdown-extensions, setuptools, tornado, urllib3). Remaining open alerts: paramiko (no patch released) and one low-severity torch advisory (torch.jit.script) fixed in torch 2.13; the supported matrix now includes 2.13 (see below), and the locked version upgrade is tracked separately.
- Verified official model-registry downloads and cached artifacts against their SHA-256 digests before loading. Registry names and aliases now take precedence over same-named implicit local paths, preventing unverified local files from shadowing registry models. Official distributions currently bundle no model artifacts and continue to download them on demand.
- Restricted v2 `.pt` artifact deserialization to weights and basic data. Legacy `.jpt` files are loaded only through the TorchScript loader and must come from a trusted source.
- Validated Python class and function references in model YAML against a default trusted set. Direct local and Hugging Face artifacts can extend or replace that set, or explicitly select unsafe loading for trusted custom code; registry models always use the fixed default set.
- Enriched and structurally validated complete Hugging Face metadata before weight access, including unambiguous `SRCoulomb` parameter recovery. Registry-backed HF fallback now treats digest-verified registry YAML and metadata as authoritative and rejects conflicting family metadata.
- Bumped the locked torch from 2.9.1 to 2.12.1 (with triton 3.7.1), moving the default environment into the supported 2.10-2.14 matrix. This clears the low-severity `torch.lstm_cell` memory-corruption advisory (patched in 2.10.0; the earlier note that both torch advisories required 2.13 no longer matches the updated advisory data) and moves the default CI lane onto an inductor with the upstream fusion-legality fix (pytorch/pytorch#172301). The torch.jit.script advisory is resolvable now that the supported matrix includes 2.13; clearing it requires bumping the locked torch to 2.13.
- Forbade the `ptfile` constructor kwarg anywhere in artifact `model_yaml`. `DispParam.__init__` runs `torch.load(ptfile, weights_only=True)` on a YAML-supplied path, and the import-path walker never inspected constructor kwargs, so a default-trusted artifact could carry an arbitrary-path read/probe/DoS primitive. The exporter always strips `ptfile` before an artifact is produced, so no legitimate artifact is affected; training-config loading is untouched.
- Cross-checked D3TS presence between `model_yaml` and the `has_embedded_d3ts` metadata flag during artifact validation. Previously the two were validated independently, so a mislabeled artifact could silently double-count or entirely lose dispersion depending on which direction it was mislabeled.
- Validated D3TS damping parameters (`a1`, `a2`, `s8`, `s6`) supplied via artifact `model_yaml`: they must be finite, non-negative real numbers. These are plain constructor floats outside the state dict, so nothing previously stopped a NaN/Inf value or `a1=a2=0` (an undamped `1/d**6` collapse) from loading silently.
- Forbade positional constructor arguments (`args`) anywhere in artifact `model_yaml`. `build_module` forwards a sibling `args` list into `func(*args, **kwargs)`, but both constructor-argument guards match keyword names only, and the parameters they protect are not keyword-only: `ptfile` is `DispParam`'s third positional parameter and `D3TS` takes its damping parameters first. A positional respelling therefore evaded both under the default trust policy — `args: [null, null, <path>]` reopened the `torch.load` arbitrary-path read/probe/DoS primitive (including a filesystem existence oracle via differing exception types) and `args: [-1.0, .nan, .inf]` reopened the undamped `1/d**6` collapse. Artifact `model_yaml` is keyword-only in practice: no in-repo YAML and none of the shipped or registry-distributed artifacts use `args`, so first-party and registry artifacts are unaffected, and rejecting the spelling outright makes the keyword guards sound rather than advisory. A third-party artifact that was exported with positional `args` before this change must be re-exported. Training-time construction never routes through this validator, so training configs may still use `args`; `aimnet export` does route the model YAML through it, so a training YAML that spells a module positionally fails at export with this message rather than at load.

### Added

- Added compiled AIMNet2 training for energy and forces in neighbor modes 0, 1, and 2, and for stress in explicit-topology modes 1 and 2. Each process captures one symbolic derivative graph whose batch, atom, and neighbor dimensions remain dynamic; there is no application-level graph cache, and the original model remains the sole owner of parameters and checkpoint state.
- Added DDP support for compiled training. The derivative runner is wrapped before distributed setup so every forward passes through DDP, each rank owns its own compiled graph and may receive different local shapes, and unused derivative-only parameters are handled without bypassing gradient reduction.
- Added eager stress training through the same strain-derivative implementation used by compiled training and validation. Stress training requires a cell and aligned shift tensors for every explicit neighbor matrix; topology-free mode 0 stress is rejected.
- Added PyTorch 2.14 to the supported range. It joins the per-pull-request `tests-torch` matrix, the documented range, and the default version list of the manual GPU validation script. The resolver floor is now `torch>=2.10` with no upper bound and the locked torch stays at 2.13.0, so 2.14 is tested and supported without being required. The scheduled `torch-latest` lane keeps its job as an early-warning probe for whatever ships next; it had already been passing against 2.14.0 for weeks before this promotion.
- Added `aimnet.calculators.vibrations`, a numpy-only harmonic vibrational analysis of the calculator's dense Hessian. `analyze_hessian` symmetrizes and mass-weights the `(N, 3, N, 3)` or `(3N, 3N)` Hessian, projects out rigid translations and rotations with an SVD-orthonormalized basis (three for a single atom, five for a linear molecule, six otherwise), diagonalizes only the vibrational subspace, and returns wavenumbers in cm^-1 with imaginary modes as negative values, vibrational quanta in eV, and unit-norm Cartesian normal modes; `vibrational_analysis(calc, data)` wraps the `hessian=True` evaluation for a single structure and warns when the model embeds a dispersion module whose curvature the Hessian currently omits. Unlike `ase.vibrations.VibrationsData`, which does not project rigid-body motions, or the former `sorted(freqs)[6:]` recipe, which mishandled linear molecules and could hide an imaginary mode, the result is orientation-independent and correct for linear and near-linear geometries. Masses come from the bundled `aimnet.constants` table, so no ASE install is required; the geometry-optimization tutorial's thermochemistry step now uses it.
- Added `aimnet download <model...|--all>` to prefetch registry model weights into the local cache for offline/HPC use.
- Added `deterministic=True` calculator option: routes external DFT-D3 and DSF Coulomb through their differentiable pure-torch paths, making repeated identical evaluations bitwise reproducible on the same machine/build (issue #93). Ewald/PME kernels are not covered and warn once.
- Added weekly and manually dispatched strict fleet CI covering every official registry digest, strict-policy artifact load, and exact role-specific YAML defaults.
- Added `aimnet info` reporting package/torch/warp versions, CUDA availability, registered kernel ops, and the model cache location.
- Added a `weights` pytest marker on modules that need model weights, enabling a verified fully-offline test run (`-m "not weights ..."`) for packaging environments.
- Added unit tests for the public `SizeGroupedDataset.save_h5`, `AIMNet2Calculator.set_lr_cutoff`, and `aimnet.train.loss.mse_loss_fn` APIs, which are kept.
- Added targeted unit tests for previously untested code: `RegMultiMetric`/`regression_stats`, the `aimnet export` helper functions (`load_sae`, `bake_sae_into_model`, `mask_not_implemented_species`), `SizeGroupedDataset.cv_split`/`concatenate`, `train.utils` config/parameter helpers, and `LRCoulomb` constructor validation.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Raised the minimum supported PyTorch version to 2.10. The Torch 2.9 singleton-only sum and broadcast branches were removed. Compiled mode-1 reductions now use the ordinary scatter/gather calculation with unreachable padding rows that prevent singleton-buffer corruption on PyTorch 2.12 without changing any returned value.
- Compiled inference now always requests a full graph. Passing `compile_kwargs={"fullgraph": False}` is rejected so graph breaks cannot silently weaken the requested compilation path.
- Hessian and Hessian-vector-product requests continue to use the original eager AIMNet2 module when compiled inference is enabled; `_compiled_forward` is only a callable referencing that same module and never replaces the model or duplicates its parameters.
- **BREAKING:** `peratom_loss_fn` now computes mean squared error over real atoms (`numbers != 0`) in every neighbor mode. This makes padded mode 0 use the same per-atom normalization as modes 1 and 2. Mode-1 atom counts now ignore the final dummy atom and always produce exactly one count per declared system, including when the dummy has its own molecule-index bucket.
- Requesting `compile_model=True` for a legacy TorchScript `.jpt` model now raises immediately. Legacy models remain usable without compilation rather than silently accepting an unused compile option.
- **BREAKING:** Added canonical global packed mode 2 for batched sparse neighbor matrices. `(B, N, M)` neighbor matrices now carry global atom indices `b * N + j` with the sentinel `B * N`, every system must reserve its final atom slot as a dummy (`numbers[:, -1] == 0`), and full-3D periodic inputs must supply aligned integral lattice shifts of shape `(B, N, M, 3)`. Legacy 3D matrices with per-system local indices are rejected on every entry path; convert them with `aimnet.nbops.convert_mode2_local_to_global`. The converter does not add the dummy row, so a caller whose padded capacity was exactly filled must first extend `coord`, `numbers`, and every neighbor matrix by one padded slot. Inputs are validated before any kernel runs (index bounds, per-system ownership, packed sentinel tails, shift alignment, finite coordinates, non-singular cells): once per plain evaluation, with a Hessian request on a batch validating the batch before the split and each subsystem once more, and a standalone model validating every call; the check traces under `torch.compile` without graph breaks, and a violation surfaces on CUDA and in compiled code as a device-side assertion (`RuntimeError`), on eager CPU as `ValueError`. Ewald estimates its splitting parameter and k-space cutoff per system and PME one parameter set per batch, both from the real atoms only, so a mode-2 energy matches the flat evaluation to rounding whatever the padding width, and a system made of dummy rows only contributes zero energy without influencing the others, provided it carries a non-singular cell (copy a real one into padded slots; a zero cell has no reciprocal lattice). A batch in which every system is dummy rows only is rejected, matching the flat path. A single `(3, 3)` or `(1, 3, 3)` cell shared by a batch is broadcast to every system, like a `(3,)` `pbc`; the pure-torch ConvSV fallback masks the features it gathers for excluded neighbor slots instead of relying on a pre-masked geometry tensor. Because mode-2 callers supply the neighbor lists, `nbmat_coulomb` must be built at the Ewald/PME real-space cutoff. The declared cutoff is checked against that estimate for whichever list the Coulomb sum resolved to, and a warning is raised when it is shorter or when no cutoff was declared at all; reusing the model's short-range list instead costs of order 1 eV and 0.1 eV/A in forces for a condensed-phase cell. The calculator accepts the additional optional keys `nbmat_coulomb`, `nbmat_dftd3`, `shifts_coulomb`, `shifts_dftd3`, `cutoff_lr`, `cutoff_coulomb`, and `cutoff_dftd3`. See the calculator docs section "Batched sparse neighbor matrices (mode 2)" for the contract and migration steps.
- Migrated PME to the nvalchemiops energy+autograd API, completing the Ewald migration from #105 (fixes #106). PME inference forces/stress, force/stress training, dense Hessians, and HVPs now all flow through the calculator's total-energy autograd; the legacy explicit-terms path, the local `_PeriodicCoulombFunction` training wrapper, and the fixed-charge finite-difference Hessian/HVP helpers are removed. PME Hessians and HVPs are now **relaxed-charge** (they include the `d^2E/(dq.dr)` charge-response coupling), the same contract as DSF and Ewald — Ewald and PME are now directly comparable for vibrational analysis, while DSF still differs by its shifted-force truncation near the cutoff; values shift slightly against the former fixed-charge FD Hessians. The dense PME Hessian (`eval(..., hessian=True)`) is now returned in the force dtype (typically float32, matching Ewald since #105) instead of the FD block's float64; `hessian_vector_product` keeps its documented float64 return for periodic backends. `ExternalDerivativeTerms` loses its `hessian` field (no producer remains); external code constructing or reading it must drop the field. The `nvalchemi-toolkit-ops` floor moves from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1: on 0.4.0 an upstream composed-graph charge-gradient bug corrupts PME train-mode forces on the energy-graph route (max error 4.5 eV/A, 100% of force elements, on the tests/data spiro crystal; 0.4.1 is clean at the 1e-6 GPU noise floor), so selecting PME now raises `RuntimeError` on 0.4.0 — the pyproject pin alone would not protect already-installed environments from silent force corruption. This also retires the last upstream `DeprecationWarning` from the deprecated direct-output flags.
- **BREAKING:** Model loading now routes TorchScript only for `.jpt` files, gives bare registry names precedence over same-named implicit local paths, rejects inconsistent v2 metadata and incomplete weights, requires lowercase registry SHA-256 digests, and uses exact role-specific default YAML imports instead of the broad `torch.nn.*` namespace. See the model-format migration notes for remedies.
- Split artifact checks into envelope, structural, canonical-distribution, and effective-calculator validation. Structurally valid direct and complete custom HF artifacts may explicitly disable external Coulomb or dispersion, while registry, registry-backed HF, and exported artifacts retain canonical action-flag requirements.
- Made `aimnet export` validate canonical artifacts before atomically replacing the destination, preserve existing output on failure, record embedded D3TS metadata, and accept explicit trusted custom constructor paths through `--model-import-path`.
- Marked legacy `.jpt` runtime metadata as embedded-LR while retaining format version 1 and embedded-module defaults. Consolidated v2 construction, state loading, and source-routing predicates without expanding the stable top-level models API.
- Hardened `make test`: the parallel run now hides CUDA and caps per-worker threads (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`); previously xdist workers either all initialized the first GPU (OOM on CUDA boxes) or oversubscribed the CPU with per-worker torch thread pools. A new `make test-gpu` target runs the GPU-marked tests serially on CUDA.
- Bumped `nvalchemi-toolkit-ops` to `>=0.4.0` and `warp-lang` to `>=1.13,<2` (installs 1.15). Energies, charges, and Hessians are bit-identical to 0.3.1; explicit force/virial outputs shift within float32 accumulation noise (max 6.7e-05 eV/A on a periodic system, 40x inside the project's cross-version acceptance of 1e-4 Hartree/A). The 0.4.0 direct-output flags used by the Ewald/PME path (`compute_forces`/`compute_virial`) are deprecated upstream; both Ewald and PME have since migrated to the autograd-based API (see the PME migration entry above).

- Marked the expensive tail of the test suite (~60 test nodes ≥2 s each: torch.compile, model-format roundtrips, dense-Hessian/HVP comparisons, multi-model ASE runs) with the `slow` marker; the default CPU test run now completes in under two minutes. Run `pytest -m slow` for the marked tail. The cheapest representative of each critical path (dense Hessian, HVP correctness, legacy `.jpt` loading, torch.compile smoke) stays in the default set.
- Silenced the spurious "Warp CUDA error 100" stderr line emitted at import on CPU-only hosts.
- Made optional-dependency install hints installer-neutral (conda equivalents where they exist; pysisyphus named directly since it is pip-only).
- Extended the supported torch matrix through 2.14: CI covers torch 2.10-2.14 on CPU; GPU-side validation across that range is performed on CUDA hardware as part of the release gate.

### Fixed

- Refused Hessians, Hessian-vector products, and stress for a model that carries a tabulated DFT-D3 module inside its own module tree, instead of returning a number that silently omits dispersion. That module's energy reaches autograd through a first-order-only `autograd.Function`: its backward multiplies a saved, graph-free force tensor, so the second derivative is structurally zero, and it returns no gradient for `cell`, so the periodic image term never contributes. Measured against finite differences, the dispersion Hessian block was absent entirely and about 95% of the dispersion virial was lost, worth 1.68 GPa of pressure on a test crystal, with nothing raised. Energy and forces were always correct and are unaffected. No registry model is affected: dispersion is attached externally, the default artifact policy rejects `aimnet.modules.DFTD3` as an untrusted import path, and the exporter strips it. Load a model so the calculator owns dispersion externally, or use `D3TS`, which differentiates correctly.
- Detected an affected model by class rather than by the key its dispersion module sits under. The previous test asked whether anything was registered at `dftd3`/`d3bj`, which warned for `D3TS` under that key, where there is no defect, and stayed silent for a `DFTD3` under any other key, where there is. The new `has_embedded_tabulated_dftd3` predicate tests the class; `has_externalizable_dftd3` keeps its key semantics, which are what neighbor-list sizing needs. The narrower warning added to `vibrational_analysis` is removed, superseded by the calculator refusing the operation with a remedy.
- Fixed the adaptive neighbor list silently dropping neighbors, which made a reused calculator return different energies for the same geometry depending on what it had evaluated before. `AdaptiveNeighborList` relied on `NeighborOverflowError` to grow its buffer, but in matrix mode nvalchemiops never raises it: it reports the true count in `num_neighbors` while returning only `max_neighbors` columns, so the retry branch was unreachable and the trim to `actual_max` was a no-op on an already-truncated list. The shrink heuristic then fed an undersized buffer forward with no way back up, so any evaluation on a sparser system permanently capped every later one (measured: caffeine shifts by 7.8e-03 eV after one single-atom evaluation on the same calculator, and a periodic cell by +79.7 eV / 19.7 eV/A after one sparser evaluation; repeated calls on a truncated list were not even stable). The buffer now grows and rebuilds whenever the reported count exceeds the allocated width. The cluster-tile kernels that CUDA selects for fully periodic float32 input raise instead of truncating; that retry now also grows straight to the reported count with headroom instead of by 1.5x of the current width per attempt (12 rebuilds down to 1 on a 13,824-atom cell). Affects every `AdaptiveNeighborList` user -- the main, LR, Coulomb and dispersion lists -- on any path that reaches `make_nbmat` (PBC, CPU, caller-supplied `mol_idx`, `N > nb_threshold`, or `nb_threshold=0`). A freshly constructed calculator was correct only for systems within the initial density estimate of about 0.2 atoms/A^3 -- a 64-atom, 6.4 A periodic cell at a 5 A cutoff was truncated on its very first call -- and those first-call cases are fixed by the same branch; results that were already correct are unchanged.
- Treated the module tree, not metadata, as ground truth when detecting embedded long-range modules, so an artifact whose metadata flag contradicts its own contents still gets a long-range neighbor list (issue #118, third pass). The previous fix consulted the module tree only when `metadata is None`; a shipped solvation artifact carries a metadata dict declaring `has_embedded_lr=False` and `has_embedded_d3ts=False` while holding an `outputs.d3bj` submodule, so the detection helper was correct and never reached — `lr` stayed False and every system above `nb_threshold` raised `KeyError: ['_dftd3', '_lr']` (measured: 119 atoms works, 125 fails). `_has_embedded_dispersion` carried the same gate, so correcting only `has_embedded_lr` left `cutoff_lr` at `inf` and turned the `KeyError` into a `[125, 8.4e17]` allocation overflow; both now inspect the module tree unconditionally. A wrong flag can only ever cause a _missing_ long-range list, never a spurious one. Energies below `nb_threshold` are unchanged bit-for-bit. Note the existing `model_yaml`/`has_embedded_d3ts` artifact cross-check does not catch this case, which carries a D3BJ rather than a D3TS module.
- Excluded the local weight cache (`aimnet/calculators/assets/`) from wheels and sdists explicitly, instead of relying on hatchling's `.gitignore` handling.
- Fixed embedded-LR models failing with `KeyError: nbmat_lr` on every flattened evaluation (molecules above `nb_threshold` on CUDA, any size on CPU, PBC, or Hessians): when metadata declared `has_embedded_lr` but neither dispersion nor Coulomb could be identified, the calculator built no long-range neighbor list at all despite resolving an all-pairs `cutoff_lr` for exactly that case. The shared LR list is now built with that cutoff (issue #118).
- Detected embedded long-range modules from the module tree for pre-metadata artifacts: a model carrying a D3TS, DFTD3/D3BJ, or LRCoulomb submodule but no metadata dict previously had `lr=False`, so no LR neighbor list was built and flattened evaluations failed with `KeyError: nbmat_lr` (issue #118, reopened case).
- Trusted the `aimnet.modules.lr.D3TS` submodule spelling of the D3TS class in the default artifact allowlist, alongside the existing `aimnet.modules.D3TS` barrel spelling. The loader machinery that detects D3TS by class name matches the "D3TS" substring regardless of spelling, so an artifact using this spelling was recognized as D3TS by the export layer but rejected by the exact-match allowlist.
- Fixed `DataGroup.cv_split` corrupting cross-validation folds: building each fold's train split mutated the shared parts in place via `cat()`, so later folds contained duplicated samples and validation splits larger than the dataset. Folds are now built without mutating the shared parts.
- Fixed a crash when torch has CUDA but warp-lang does not (possible with conda-forge variant packages): the AEV kernel gate now checks warp CUDA availability and falls back to the pure-torch path with a one-time warning.

### Removed

- Removed the Codecov integration: the seven coverage upload steps, `codecov.yaml`, the `validate-codecov-config` workflow, and the README badge. No upload ever succeeded. Codecov reports the repository as never activated, with zero commits recorded, and every run logged `Token required - not valid tokenless upload` while the action's default `fail_ci_if_error: false` kept the job green. Coverage status checks were already disabled, so nothing gated on it and the badge advertised "unknown". Test jobs still measure coverage; nothing consumes the report.
- Removed unused `DataGroup.to_dict`, `DataGroup.merge`, `DataGroup.rename_key`, `SizeGroupedDataset.merge`, and `SizeGroupedDataset.rename_datakey` (no callers in-repo or in downstream projects).
- Removed unused `aimnet.train.utils.make_seed` and `aimnet.ops.lazy_calc_dij_lr`.
- Removed unused `LRCoulomb.coul_ewald` and `LRCoulomb.coul_pme` convenience wrappers; use `LRCoulomb.forward` with `method="ewald"`/`"pme"`.
- Removed unused `aimnet.modules.core.DSequential` and `aimnet.constants.get_dftd3_param`.
- Removed unused `aimnet.models.utils.has_dftd3_in_config` (and its `aimnet.models` re-export).

### Documentation

- Documented the rxn dipole origin convention: `center_coord=False` is origin-safe because the family is net-neutral-only; any future charged-system family must ship `center_coord=True`.
- Documented offline/HPC installation (cache pre-seeding via `aimnet download`, `AIMNET_CACHE_DIR`, `WARP_CACHE_PATH`) and the model weight hosting immutability policy.
